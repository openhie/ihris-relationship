  <h3>Summary</h3> <a name="summary"> </a>


  <p>
    This Implementation Guide (IG) contains the full set of specifications for the iHRIS Relationship set of resources which defines a rooted graph within the FHIR data model.  The intent of this IG is to provide a way to "flatten" FHIR resources for easy indexing and reporting for seaching and business intelligence tools (e.g ElasticSearch and Kibana).
